[06.07.2023] v1.0.4
 - Fix: When the extension is first opened, it reads the volume of the first media element present on the page. If this item is muted, the volume in the extension will be set to 0.
        For this reason, the volume of the rest of the media elements present on the page would be set to 0. Removed this feature, it was supposed to be useful but turned out to be annoying.

[01.07.2023] v1.0.3
 - Fix: Now working with YouTube streams,
 - Fix: Now correctly sets audio sliders on YouTube videos and streams.

[30.06.2023] v1.0.2
 - Fix: Volume change event on video / audio element now correctly updates volume value remembered in extension,
 - Fix: Volume value when looking at muted video / audio element was incorrect,
 - Added: Controlling muted flag of video / audio element when setting volume value to 0 or from 0 in extension,
 - Attempt: Updating volume sliders on video elements (Twitch and YouTube) but not working yet. Values on html elements are updated but visuals are not.

[09.06.2023] v1.0.1
 - Fix: Volume jump on YouTube videos when volume was set on YouTube player and then scrolled down (without opening the extension),
 - Fix: YouTube shorts - volume not set when going to next or previous,
 - Fix: Instagram stories - volume set on one story doesn't transition to next one.
  -- Works only if there is video after video (any moving thing is enough, it doesn't have to be real video) - image / photo between videos breaks it.
